## üéì Educational Concepts
This tool is designed to provide an intuitive understanding of several key concepts in probability and reliability engineering:

- **Series System Reliability:** The probability of the entire system working is the product of individual component probabilities:  
    $P(\text{System}) = P(A) \times P(B) \times P(C) \times P(D)$
- **The Weakest Link Principle:** A single component failure causes the entire system to fail.
- **Multiplication Rule for Independent Events:** See how probabilities compound in a series configuration.
- **Real-world Applications:** Understand the relevance of these concepts in everything from holiday lights to aerospace engineering.

## üìä The Math Behind It
The core of this simulation is the formula for the reliability of a series system. The system functions only if all of its components function.

The probability of the entire system working is the product of the reliabilities of its individual components:

$$
P(\text{System Working}) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\text{Component}_i)
$$

For our four-component system, this is:

$$
P(\text{System}) = P(A) \times P(B) \times P(C) \times P(D)
$$

This demonstrates that system reliability can never be higher than the reliability of its least reliable component.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built with modern web technologies and follows a modular design.

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (with Custom Properties), and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Core Engine (`core-engine.js`):** Manages application state, component data, and all reliability calculations.
- **3D Renderer (`tower-renderer.js`):** Uses pure CSS transforms to create the 3D environment and handle all rendering and visual effects.
- **Architecture:** Built on a modular, event-driven architecture to keep concerns separated and code maintainable.
- **No external frameworks or libraries** are required, making it lightweight and easy to study.

## üéÆ How to Use

### Interactive Controls
- **Drag & Drop:** Click and drag any popsicle stick to remove it (fail) or drop it back to its place (restore).
- **Buttons:** Use the Fail and Fix buttons for precise control over each component.
- **System Controls:** Use Reset All to fix the entire system or Random Fail to introduce a surprise failure.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+R`: Reset all components.
- `Ctrl+F`: Trigger a random failure.
- `1-4` Keys: Toggle the state of components A through D.
- `ESC`: Close any open modal or notification.
